/**
 * The two record fields the catalogue does not supply, derived identically by
 * the database builder and the browser.
 *
 * Neither upstream catalogue carries a blurb or a rights statement. Both are
 * written here from fields that do exist, and marked `derived` so the page can
 * say so rather than passing them off as the publisher's own words.
 *
 * Why this file exists at all: stored, they were 377 of the 1,240 bytes each
 * record cost in the `docs` table — about 117 MB across 309,418 books, in a
 * database that has to stay under Cloudflare's 512 MB cacheable ceiling. They
 * are a pure function of fields the browser already has, so the browser
 * computes them and the database does not carry them. Shared rather than
 * reimplemented, on the same reasoning as tokenize.js: two copies of a
 * formatting rule drift, and the page would start describing books
 * differently from the way the build described them.
